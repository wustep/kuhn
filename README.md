Stephen's Kuhn Honors &amp; Scholars House Work Tools

# TV Generator - /tv/ - PHP, Javascript, HTML
Generate images for the TV room schedule at the front desk by typing them directly into a webapp. 

[Live Demo](http://wustep.me/kuhn/tv/)

This webapp saves significant time compared to using the software provided by Samsung. Ideally, this script could be developed to procedurally generate the TV output based on the calendars of those rooms.

# Find People Tool - /findppl/ - Python
Given a .txt file of OSU students with names and dot numbers in the form (wu.2719), output to a csv file a list with their positions and organizations. 

This script was used to save several hours on a task of manually using Ohio State's [Find People Tool](https://www.osu.edu/findpeople/) to fill out positions and organizations for a list of ~600+ faculty.
