⚒ Stephen's Kuhn Honors &amp; Scholars House Work Tools

These tools were developed during my time working as a Communication Assistant at The Ohio State University's Kuhn Honors & Scholars center.

# TV Generator - /tv/ - PHP, Javascript, HTML
Generate images for the TV room schedule at the front desk by typing them directly into a webapp. 

This webapp saves significant time compared to using the software provided by Samsung. Ideally, this script could be developed to procedurally generate the TV output based on the calendars of those rooms, accessing the Outlook API.

# Find People Tool - /findppl/ - Python
Given a .txt file of OSU students with names and dot numbers in the form (wu.2719), output to a csv file a list with their positions and organizations. 

This script was used to save several hours on a task of manually using Ohio State's [Find People Tool](https://www.osu.edu/findpeople/) to fill out positions and organizations for a list of ~600+ faculty.

# Batch Photo Crop - /photocrop/ - Python
Batch square crop photos using face recognition provided by the [Croppola API](http://croppola.com/documentation/). This was used to save time in cropping dozens of photos of students.
